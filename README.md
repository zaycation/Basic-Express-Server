## Simple Express Server Template

This is based on the server for [NucampSite](https://github.com/zaycation/nucampsite)

If you would like to utilize this template, please simply change "campsites" in server.js and everywhere else with whatever the main concept of your site is. For example, if your website is to upload images, "campsites" might need to be replaced with "images".
